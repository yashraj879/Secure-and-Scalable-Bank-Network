Secure and scalable bank network which shows the use of DHCP, ACL and OSPF. This project aims to design and implement a secure, scalable bank network using Cisco Packet Tracer, connecting four branch offices to a central head office. The central head office will host a Bank Management System (BMS) server, which is crucial for managing bank accounts and facilitating client interactions. The network will use dynamic routing with Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) to ensure reliable and efficient communication between the head office and the branches. This dynamic routing protocol will allow the network to adapt to any changes and maintain uninterrupted communication. Each branch will have its own network and DHCP services, ensuring that client devices can obtain dynamic IP addresses for seamless connectivity. The use of DHCP will help in managing the IP address allocation efficiently, especially considering the varying numbers of client devices at each branch. To secure the network, Access Control Lists (ACLs) will be implemented, restricting unauthorized devices and ensuring that only legitimate devices can access the centralized BMS server at the head office. The deliverables for this project will include a detailed network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer, router configurations for OSPF, DHCP, and ACLs, along with testing logs that demonstrate successful communication and effective ACL restrictions. This project delivers a scalable, secure, and efficient network solution that meets current operational needs and provides a foundation for future growth, ensuring the companyâ€™s communication and connectivity requirements are met.
